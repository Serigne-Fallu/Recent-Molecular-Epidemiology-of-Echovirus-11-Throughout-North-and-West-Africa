Recent Molecular Epidemiology of Echovirus 11 Throughout North and West Africa Resulted in the First Identification of a Recombinant Strain from an Acute Flaccid Paralysis Case in West Africa

Abstract: Echovirus 11 has emerged as a major public health concern, causing sepsis in neonates
in many European countries in recent years. In Africa, especially West Africa, where resources and
diagnostic capacities are limited, only sporadic cases have been reported. To better understand
the recent molecular epidemiology of E11 in West Africa, we characterized twenty-three echovirus
11 strains isolated through the acute flaccid paralysis and environmental surveillance systems for polio
from 2013 to 2023, using high-throughput sequencing. Our data are noteworthy due to identifying
for the first time a recombinant strain from an acute flaccid paralysis case and represent the first
focus to date on molecular characterization of echovirus 11 in West Africa. Moreover, our data
show that echovirus 11 diverged from 1970 (95% HPD range, 1961â€“1979) and evolved into four
distinct clades, with the virus spread from West Africa to Europe, exhibiting two introductions in
France around 2017, from Senegal and Guinea. Furthermore, the in silico analysis reveals four nonconservative amino acid substitutions in the VP1 sequences of the European strains associated with
neonatal sepsis in newborns and a conserved amino acid motif in the VP1 protein toward enterovirus
genotypes. Our data provide new insights into the epidemiology of echovirus 11 and point to the
crucial need to implement specific surveillance programs targeting non-polio enteroviruses for the
rapid identification of emerging or re-emerging enterovirus species, particularly in Africa.
